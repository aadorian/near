# One Hour of Web3 Code


**The Problem:**

Onboarding users in the web3 community and blockchain ecosystem is not an easy task.

**The Solution:** Education, Education & Education 

For a community to adopt a technology, it must first understand it. In order to understand it, education plays a key role. Children are the ones who will use and adopt these future blockchain technologies, therefore education should be focused on them. In the learning coding community there are successfull projects  such as One Hour of Code 
https://hourofcode.com/us so the proposal is to replicate this experience.

**Project summary:**

A first approach of this project is to post in multiple social networks (both chain and off chain) blockchain concepts, where teachers, CEOs, artists worldwide could explain in 1 minute videos what this ecosystem complex concepts means. 

For example concepts as: 

###  VR 
 * What is a VR headset? 
 * What is a HMD? 
 * What are the differences between VR / AR and MR?*
### NFT  
* What is a Blockchain ? 
* What is Bitcoin ? 
* What is Ethereum ? 
* What is a Cryptocurrency ? 
* What are the differences between NFT and ERC20? 
* What is a NFT? or even What is a ERC721 Token?
